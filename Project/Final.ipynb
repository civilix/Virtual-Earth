    "# Modeling the Dispersion of Flatus with Initial Velocity in a Confined 2D Space using a PDE Approach\n",

    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This report outlines a mathematical model to simulate the dispersion of flatus (gas) released with an initial velocity within a two-dimensional, enclosed horizontal plane. The model is based on the **Advection-Diffusion Equation**, a partial differential equation (PDE) that effectively describes the transport of a substance in a fluid medium. This framework accounts for two primary physical phenomena: advection, the bulk transport of the gas due to an initial velocity field, and diffusion, the molecular-level dispersion of the gas from regions of higher concentration to lower concentration. We define the complete system, including the governing equation, appropriate initial conditions to represent the release, and no-flux boundary conditions to model the confinement of the space.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The dispersion of a gas in a room is a common physical process governed by the principles of fluid dynamics and mass transfer. In this specific scenario, we aim to model the propagation of flatus, which is unique in that its release is often accompanied by an initial velocity, or jet. This initial momentum (advection) plays a significant role in the initial stages of dispersion, while random molecular motion (diffusion) becomes more dominant over time, leading to a more uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately capture this behavior, we will model the concentration of the flatus gas as a scalar field evolving in time and space. The chosen domain is a two-dimensional horizontal plane, representing a simplified top-down view of a closed room.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Mathematical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The most appropriate model for this phenomenon is the Advection-Diffusion Equation. This PDE describes how the concentration of a substance changes over time under the influence of both bulk motion and gradient-driven diffusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Governing Equation: The Advection-Diffusion Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of the equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**∂C/∂t + ∇ ⋅ (−D∇C + uC) = 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "*   `C` is the concentration of the substance (a function of position and time).\n",
    "*   `t` is time.\n",
    "*   `∇` is the gradient operator.\n",
    "*   `D` is the diffusion coefficient.\n",
    "*   `u` is the velocity field of the medium (air).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a constant velocity field or under the assumption of an incompressible fluid (`∇ ⋅ u = 0`), the equation simplifies to a more common form:\n",
    "\n",
    "**∂C/∂t + u ⋅ ∇C = D∇²C**\n",
    "\n",
    "This form clearly separates the key physical processes and is the one we will use for our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Domain and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Domain (`Ω`)**: A bounded, two-dimensional domain representing the enclosed horizontal space, e.g., a rectangle `Ω = [0, L] × [0, W]`.\n",
    "*   **Concentration (`C(x, y, t)`)**: A scalar function representing the concentration of the flatus odorant at a point `(x, y)` at time `t`.\n",
    "*   **Velocity Field (`u(x, y, t)`)**: A vector field `u = (u_x, u_y)` representing the velocity of the air. This field accounts for the initial velocity of the flatus.\n",
    "*   **Diffusion Coefficient (`D`)**: A positive constant representing the rate at which the flatus diffuses in still air. Its value depends on the specific gases involved and the ambient temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Deconstruction of the Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the simplified PDE: `∂C/∂t + u ⋅ ∇C = D∇²C`\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`∂C/∂t` (Temporal Derivative Term)**: This term represents the rate of change of concentration at a specific point in space. It is the quantity we are solving for.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`u ⋅ ∇C` (Advection/Convection Term)**: This term, `u_x * ∂C/∂x + u_y * ∂C/∂y`, models the transport of concentration due to the bulk fluid motion. The velocity field `u` \"carries\" the concentration `C` with it. This is where the \"initial velocity\" of the flatus has its primary effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`D∇²C` (Diffusion Term)**: This term, `D * (∂²C/∂x² + ∂²C/∂y²)`, models the transport of the substance due to random molecular motion, following Fick's second law. The Laplacian operator `∇²` ensures that the substance moves from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration, effectively \"smoothing out\" the concentration profile over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Initial and Boundary Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the PDE, we must specify the state of the system at the beginning (`t=0`) and its behavior at the boundaries of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Initial Conditions (at t=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Initial Concentration `C(x, y, 0)`:**\n",
    "We assume the flatus is released at a specific point `(x₀, y₀)` at `t=0`. A two-dimensional Gaussian distribution is a suitable model for this instantaneous release, representing a high concentration at the source that fades with distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "`C(x, y, 0) = C₀ * exp( -[(x-x₀)² + (y-y₀)²] / (2σ²) )`\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `C₀` is the maximum initial concentration at the source.\n",
    "*   `(x₀, y₀)` is the point of release.\n",
    "*   `σ` is the standard deviation, controlling the initial size of the gas cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Initial Velocity Field `u(x, y, 0)`:**\n",
    "The \"initial velocity\" is modeled as a vector field. A simple approach is to define a non-zero velocity vector `v = (v_x, v_y)` within a small region around the release point and zero elsewhere. For a more complex model, this velocity field could be set to decay over time due to air resistance (viscosity).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Boundary Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the space is \"enclosed,\" no mass can exit the domain. This is modeled with a **Homogeneous Neumann boundary condition**, also known as a **no-flux** condition. It states that the component of the total flux perpendicular to the boundary is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total flux `J` is given by `J = −D∇C + uC`. The boundary condition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**n ⋅ J |<sub>∂Ω</sub> = 0  =>  n ⋅ (−D∇C + uC) |<sub>∂Ω</sub> = 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `∂Ω` represents the boundary (walls) of the domain.\n",
    "*   `n` is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume the air velocity at the walls is zero (`u |<sub>∂Ω</sub> = 0`), the condition simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "**n ⋅ ∇C |<sub>∂Ω</sub> = 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the concentration gradient normal to the wall is zero, preventing any substance from diffusing through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. The Complete PDE System\n",
    "\n",
    "The full mathematical problem to be solved is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Governing Equation:**\n",
    "    `∂C/∂t + u ⋅ ∇C = D∇²C`  for `(x, y)` in `Ω` and `t > 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Initial Condition:**\n",
    "    `C(x, y, 0) = C₀ * exp( -[(x-x₀)² + (y-y₀)²] / (2σ²) )`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Boundary Condition:**\n",
    "    `n ⋅ (−D∇C + uC) = 0` on the boundary `∂Ω`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Numerical Simulation and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "This PDE system does not typically have a simple analytical solution and must be solved using numerical methods, such as:\n",
    "*   **Finite Difference Method (FDM)**\n",
    "*   **Finite Element Method (FEM)**\n",
    "*   **Finite Volume Method (FVM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this system on a computer would yield the concentration `C(x, y, t)` at any point in the room for any time `t > 0`. The output can be visualized as a heat map that evolves over time, showing the initial directed movement of the gas cloud followed by its gradual, isotropic expansion until it fills the space at a near-uniform, low concentration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Advection-Diffusion PDE provides a robust and physically accurate framework for modeling the dispersion of flatus with initial velocity in a confined 2D space. By correctly defining the governing equation, initial conditions representing the release, and no-flux boundary conditions for the enclosure, one can generate a detailed simulation of the concentration profile over time. This model effectively captures the interplay between the initial directed motion (advection) and the subsequent molecular spreading (diffusion)."
